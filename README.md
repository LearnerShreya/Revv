## Project Overview

REVV is a modern CRM system designed to replace manual spreadsheet-based lead tracking used by HSR Motors. The platform enables real-time lead capture, fast follow-ups, and clear sales visibility for both sales representatives and business managers.

The system focuses on eliminating delays, improving collaboration, and providing data-driven insights so that every lead is handled efficiently from interest to ownership.

## Problem Statement

HSR Motors currently uses static spreadsheets to manage sales leads, which creates three major issues:

1. **Lead decay** due to delayed follow-ups from manual entry.  
2. **Collaboration silos** where sales reps cannot see real-time updates from others.  
3. **Lack of visibility** into which marketing channels generate quality leads.

These gaps lead to lost revenue opportunities and inefficient decision-making.

## Solution

REVV transforms spreadsheet-based workflows into a centralized sales cockpit. It unifies all lead sources, automates follow-ups, and provides analytics that help managers optimize performance and marketing spend.

## Key Features

### Omni-Channel Lead Capture
Automatically captures leads from Facebook Ads, Google Search, website forms, and offline sources with zero manual entry.

### Hot-Lead Scoring
Leads are automatically prioritized based on high-intent actions such as using the EMI calculator or requesting a quote.

### Integrated Communication
Sales reps can call or message leads directly from the CRM. All interactions are logged automatically.

### Live Collaboration
Sales reps can mention managers in notes to get quick approvals for discounts or trade-ins without leaving the system.

### Funnel Analytics
Dashboards visualize conversion rates by source, sales rep performance, and funnel drop-offs.

## User Flow

1. A lead is generated from a marketing channel and instantly appears in REVV.  
2. The sales rep reviews the lead details and activity history.  
3. The rep contacts the customer directly through the system.  
4. The lead is moved through defined sales stages with reminders.  
5. Managers track performance and optimize inventory and marketing strategy using the dashboard.

## Screens and Design

- **Lead Listing Screen:** Priority-based table with lead age, source, and status.  
- **Lead Detail Screen:** Complete customer profile with interaction timeline.  
- **Lead Management Screen:** Status progression and task scheduler.  
- **Dashboard Screen:** Analytics for lead sources, rep performance, and funnel conversion.
